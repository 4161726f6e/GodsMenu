# GodsMenu
## Automated weekly menu generator
A tkinter GUI Python program for the purposes of creating a weekly menu of nightly meals and two weekend breakfasts. Random choices are made from entries in associated CSV files. Use checkboxes to generate choices based upon a selection of proteins, vegetables, and carbs.

I designed this for a fan of the K-pop group "Stray Kidz" - hence the name and random Korean lyrics shown when you start the program.

Note: Modify CSV files to adjust selection content. Works well with pyinstaller if you want an exe.
